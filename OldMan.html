    <p><b>Old man look at my life,
    I'm a lot like you were.
    Old man look at my life,
    I'm a lot like you were.</b></P>

    <p>Old man look at my life,
    Twenty four
    and there's so much more
    Live alone in a paradise
    That makes me think of two.</p>

    <p>Love lost, such a cost,
    Give me things
    that don't get lost.
    Like a coin that won't get tossed
    Rolling home to you.</p>

    <p><b>Old man take a look at my life
    I'm a lot like you
    I need someone to love me
    the whole day through
    Ah, one look in my eyes
    and you can tell that's true.</b></p>

    <p>Lullabies, look in your eyes,
    Run around the same old town.
    Doesn't mean that much to me
    To mean that much to you.</p>

    <p>I've been first and last
    Look at how the time goes past.
    But I'm all alone at last.
    Rolling home to you.</p>

    <p><b>Old man take a look at my life
    I'm a lot like you
    I need someone to love me
    the whole day through
    Ah, one look in my eyes
    and you can tell that's true.</b></p>

    <p><b>Old man look at my life,
    I'm a lot like you were.
    Old man look at my life,
    I'm a lot like you were.</b></p>
